# Uria
Uria is a C++ developped, in-terminal apllication, implementing a notebook, calendar and reminder using Ncurses library.

# File saving

For now, the content of the notepad text is contained in a file called NOTEPAD.
You must create a new directory called ```filesave``` at the root of the project to save the content of the notepad tool.
If you wish to change the default directory, edit the constructor of the FileManager class.

# How to build and run Uria
Using a CLI, start by building the executable with the following command:
```make re```
Then, run Uria with this command:
```./uria```
